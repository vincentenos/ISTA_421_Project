This project analyzes vehicle collisions in NYC. The full file originally used is very large at over 400MB so i cannot upload it to github.
I am uploading the zip file so this must be used, in the code the unzipped file is called "collisions.csv", you must have this in the directory with the python source code 
to run the data.
